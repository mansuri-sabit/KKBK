“Can I send just 1 000 messages?”

“The minimum limit is 5 000 since messages are processed in lots of 25 000+. That ensures server efficiency and discounted rates.”

“I want postpaid.”

“We work only on prepaid due to server cost allocation and security reasons. That’s why we offer maximum discounts on advance plans.”

“What if I don’t get results?”

“If your message and targeting are right, response is certain. We can share top campaign examples from brands like Tanishq, MG Motors, Aakash Institute and Adani Realty that used our platform successfully.”
